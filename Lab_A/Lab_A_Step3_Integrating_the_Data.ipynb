We already have the means of importing and handling all the data streams, but we do not yet have a mechanism to integrate them. For the integration we will need to know where the sensors are in relation to each other, which we will handle through a **Vessel** class, and we also will need to combine the observations which we will handle through an **Integration** class\n",

    "The integration consists of determining the positions of the transducers at both transmit and reception time and then finding the location of the seafloor relative to it. This implies that we need to have a mechanism of determining all the sensor values at transmit and receipt time, but since the sensors are asynchronous it is unlikely that there are data at these exact epochs. Thus we first need to interpolate the various data. We also need to determine the position of the sensors at the time of transmit and receipt with respect to each other, which implies that we have to do a transformation of the Vessel lever arms and also transform them to geo-referenced coordinates. Finally you will need to transform the **twtt** to a distance and offset this from the position of the transducers to determine the depth, which means that there needs to be a method of transforming twtt to distance.\n"

Since we know the lever arms of both the positioning system and the transmit transducer we can determine the offsets in a georeferenced frame if we apply the rotations. To rotate the positioning system lever arm at the time of transmit we need to use the `R_Tx[ping]` matrix i.e., the total rotation for the current ping.\n",

We will make the assumption that the signal traveled straight down and back up. This creates a problem as the transmit transducer at the time of transmission is not in the same place as the receive transducer at time of reception. What should we use for the position? If we make the assumption that it took the signal as long to travel from the transmit transducer to the seafloor as it took to travel back to the reception transducer we may make the assumption that the position associated to the measured TWTT is the mean of the two transducer positions i.e., we may assume that there is a virtual transducer at that location. \n",
