    "## Integration of Data Streams\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab you will navigate the transmitter and receiver of a multibeam for the case of a (near) vertically oriented beam. This special case may be treated as a (narrow beam) single beam echo sounder through ignoring the array-relative angles of transmission and reception. The amount of work needed for this lab is significant and the lab is therefore broken-up in several steps. You will do some programming for all of the steps, and at the end will be asked some questions about the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first step requires the integration of position data from a point source sensor (either a GNSS receiver for a surface platform or an acoustic transponder for a submerged vehicle), and measures of the instantaneous orientation of the vessel reference frame at transmission and reception of the acoustic signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the sensors acquiring the three sets of observations (sonar-relative range, position and orientation) are not co-located. Thus you must allow for the **lever arms** between the sensors. For example, here the relative Vessel Rererence Frame (**VRF**) offsets of the transmitter, receiver and GPS antenna are provided. For this lab we will assume that the orientation time series represents the VRF (thus ignoring the Motion Reference Unit (**MRU**) to VRF misalignment), and that the heave solution is provided for the Reference Point (**RP**), which is the origin of the VRF.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sensors used for the collection of the data are **asynchronous** that is: they do not collect data at the exact same times, thus you will need to resample the data. You will do this through linear interpolation."

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data provided here were collected by the USNS Henson, a 100m long **hydrographic** survey vessel. It operates an EM710 multibeam which is mounted in a gondola about 7m below the water line. It uses a POS/MV 320 for orientation. The available Ellipsoid referencing is from a NavCom (C-Nav) receiver generating 1Hz RTG heights from the masthead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vessel was operating in approximately 100 m of water in open ocean conditions in the Western Pacific. The data is from a half hour period when the vessel was steaming at about 12 **knots** and undertook a 180 degree turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ellipsoid heights have already been converted to Geoid heights using EMG08.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data streams that you will integrate consist of \n",
    "1. Motion (**roll, pitch, heading, heave**) at 100 Hz\n",
    "2. Antenna positions as **geodetic** latitudes and longitudes, and **orthometric heights**\n",
    "3. **Single beam Echosounder** Two Way Travel Times (TWTTs) at ~3Hz\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Tasks\n",
    "To determine the depths a number of steps need to be undertaken\n",
    "1. Create classes for handling and plotting the data\n",
    "2. Integrate the data by synchronizing the data streams through re-sampling and applying the necesarry **transformations**\n",
    " 1. Calculate the horizontal positions of the sonar **transducers** and **vessel refererence point (rp)** \n",
    " 2. Calculate the vertical trajectory of the sonar **transducers** and **vessel refererence point** \n",
    " 3. Calculte the bottom profile (**bathymetry**)\n",
    " 4. Compare the vertical trajectory to the collected **heave** data \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will position the sonar sensors installed on a vessel. The positioning of the sonar sensors will be achieved using position and orientation data obtained from ancillary sensors. Although a **multibeam** sonar was used for the collection of this data you are only given the TWTTs for the beam pointing straight down i.e., the data is akin to the collected by a traditional single beam echosounder.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will create depth profiles by combining the sonar positions with two way travel times. The data provided here is from a vessel with large **lever arms** undergoing approximately 1-2 m of heave and\n",
    "significant roll and pitch in the open ocean. \n",
    "\n",
    "The terrain over which the data was obtained is remarkably flat without any short wavelength **roughness**. Thus the resulting seabed profile should be smooth. As will be seen, the sonar relative ranges vary significantly as a result of the vessel vertical motions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see that the sonar relative ranges vary significantly as a result of the vessel vertical motions.\n",
    "The aim of the lab is to **reduce** those sonar relative ranges using the supplied position and orientation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, one of two vertical referencing approaches is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ellipsoid** Referenced â€“ ERS,\n",
    "2. **Chart Datum** Referenced - CRS\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually the final data will be reported with respect to a Chart Datum (**CRS** referenced data), which is a reference surface below which the water level will rarely fall. In most applications this reference is determined through water level observations. In near and off-shore applications such datums are often referred to as **tidal datums** as the bulk of the longer term water level movement is due to tides.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Positioning is done relative to a model of the Earth. Normally a biaxial ellipsoidal is used to model the earth  in which the semi-major axis describes the radius of the equator and the semi-minor axis defines the distance from the equatorial plane to the poles. You will learn more about this subject in the Geodesy course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using CRS\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically it was much more difficult to establish height above the ellipsoid (vertical position by **elevation**) than to establish the position along its surface (horizontal position by **geodetic latitude and longitude**). Thus often vessels were positioned by latitude and longitude using a positioning system. The vertical location was then estimated by combining water level observations at a tide gauge with an estimation of the draft of the vessel. \n",
    "\n",
    "A problem that occurs is that the sea state at the gauge and the vessel are different. This is addressed by filtering out the wave action at the gauge and observing  the vertical motions of the vessel due to sea state (**heave**). These heave measurements then need to be applied to the sensor observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem that occurs is that the entire vessel will move up and down in the water as a function of the speed with which it moves through the water, a phenomenon known as **settlement**. Also its bow will either pitch up or down, a phenomenon known as **squat**. To correct the sensor observations it is then necessary to create a model of the settlement and squat as a function of speed through the water.\n",
    "\n",
    "To correctly position the sonar transducers it was thus necessary to\n",
    "1. Observe water levels at a tide gauge and transfer the observations to your location using some model\n",
    "2. Observe speed through water using a **log** (device that measures speed though water) and estimate the resultant vertical motion through some settlement and squat model\n",
    "3. Observe the heave and apply it to the observed data\n",
    "4. Correct the observed data for the vertical motion induced through roll, pitch and yaw\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using ERS\n",
    "\n",
    "With the advent of positioning using **Global Navigation Satellite Sytems (GNSS)** such as GPS (USA), GLONASS (Russia), Beidou (China), Galileo (Eurpoean Union), IRNSS (India) and QZSS (Japan) it has become possible to directly estimate height above the ellipsoid with sufficient precision. This has obviated the need for observing many of the parameters other than the motion of the vessel, thereby greatly simplifying and enhancing the quality of positioning at sea. However, we still do need to correct for the motion of the vessel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if the depth data are to be referenced to a chart datum a model needs to be available to map the ellipsoid referenced data to chart datum. If such a model is not available water level data needs to be collected to enable the creation of one. However, this does not have to occur at the same time as depth data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using GRS\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we will reference the data to the EGM2008 **geoid**. Much like a reference ellipsoid a geoid is a model of the Earth, however, a far more complex one. A geoid is a model of an equipotential gravity surface whose potential is chosen so that it most closely fits Mean Sea Level (**MSL**). A fundamental property of a geoid is then that it is aligned everywhere to the local horizon plane (You will learn more about geoids in the Geodesy course).\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference ellipsoids are usually defined so that they most closely resemble a geoid model. Differences between MSL and geoids typically range on the order of a few meters, whereas differences between ellipsoids and their associated geoids may range up to hundreds of meters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference in height between a geoid and ellipsoid are known as undulations. In the case of the EGM2008 geoid there are well established undulations between it and the **WGS84** ellipsoid used by the Navstar Global Positioning System (**GPS**)\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, this lab does not entail the datum shift aspects required for CRS solution, merely reduction of the array-relative ranges to the geoid using geodetic elevation solutions of the GNSS antenna. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will create code that integrates asynchronous data to create a series of depth values referenced to the EGM 08 **Geoid**\n"
