Clearly we want to position ourselves relative to the Earth, which means that we need some geometrical description of it. We should not use the topography of the Earth as the model, otherwise both *Mount Everest* and the *Marianas Trench* would have an elevation of 0 m. Commonly people refer to elevations relative to sea level - however this is problematic as not the entire Earth is covered by an ocean. In reality a proxy is used to Mean Sea Level (**MSL**), namely an equipotential gravity field that is a best fit to MSL. This equipotential field is known as the **Geoid** which in the figure above is represented in blue. \n",

Historically we used ellipsoid that locally best fit the geoid, but with the advent of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (**GNSS**) a shift towards the use of global datums has taken place.

All points in this plane on one side of the semi-minor axis are said to have the same longitude, all points on the other side are offset by $180^{\\circ}$. The difference in longitude between two points is then the angle in the equatorial plane between the meridians associated to them. To provide a useful datum a zero meridian has been chosen, it goes through a point near the **Greenwich** Royal observatory in England. The figure above left then illustrates longitude $\\lambda$ relative to the Greenwich meridian $\\lambda_0$. \n",

The reference ellipsoid is what is referred to as a **non-zero Gaussian surface**, that is it is not possible to draw features on the ellipsoid on a flat mapping plane without inducing distortion. To draw geographic data then we need to transform all the geodetic coordinates to map coordinates using a **projection**, that is a function to systematically map all coordinates, Projections are an extensive subject that we will not delve into here, other than to say that we typically choose a projection based on its distortion properties. There, however may be other reasons too, for example aesthetic ones. In this case we will use an `Orthographic` projection for the reason that it provides an easy to understand global view of a location, and a UTM projection for the reason that it is the predominant used projection for ocean mapping at middle latitudes as it is conformal (it preserves angles in a local space) and distorts relatively little in distance in area if used properly.

    "In step 4 we made use of the capability of matplotlib to plot data given a `CRS`, which is very convenient. However, as we will see in later steps of LAB A it is also useful to perform calculations with projected coordinates, as discussed in step 4.3. This is so common that we will use the `proj_pos` numpy array to hold the projected coordinates and have the proj_str in the meta data represent the projection used to transform the geodetic coordinates to projected coordinates."

    "# 5.0 Add Projection Method\n",
    "\n",
    "In your class definition add the method `carto_project()`. The method should take the arguments: `self`, `projection_name`, and `z_reference` representing the class object, the name of the projection, and the type of height coordinates respectively. \n",

    "The `carto_project()` method will make use of the functionality of the `Proj` module. This module implements the transformation geospatial coordinates between CRSs and is used by the cartopy module that you have seen in the previous steps in this lab. For projecting data using proj we create a proj object that we then feed a string containing the properties of the projection that we want to use i.e., we need to create a string that is descriptive of the projection, such as the one shown above. In this case the string sets the projection to a UTM projection for zone 19 North, using the WGS84 geodetic datum for both input and output, and meters as the unit for the output coordinates.  \n",
