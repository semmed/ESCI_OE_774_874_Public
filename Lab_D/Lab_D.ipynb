Additionally, as these are two separate times, the translation of the entire vessel between those two times should strictly be accounted for.\n",

    "In real time, as the final navigation solution is not yet available, the convention is to have the stored location of the bottom strike referenced in a coordinate system that is relative to a fixed point in the vessel as it was at a specific epoch (usually the transmit time). We use the RP (Reference Point) not the sonar for this purpose. That coordinate system is oriented in a local level plane that is aligned along and across the vessel. As an example of why this is practical,, when editing swath data, one normally views the solutions in across track coordinates, that way one can see the shape of successive profiles and perform editing based on their coherence. Many of the artifacts present in swath data are oriented across the swath (e.g. refraction biases, wobbles).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab, you will locate the Rx and Tx relative to the RP at that instant (using lever arms and instantaneous orientation).

Thus your actual time of transmission is the nominal time of the swath PLUS the extra delay while it waits for the other sectors to fire. For example, Sector 1 fired first (at the specified time). Sector 0 fires 0.4ms later and Sector 2 fires another 0.4ms after that (0.8ms w.r.t the central sector).\n",

This is reported in a horizontal coordinate system centred on the RP and oriented along the ships heading at the time of transmit. Thus one has along track values that are typically 15-16m as the sonars are 15-16m ahead of the RP, and the across track values range from -160 m (to port side) to +156 m (to starboard side).\n",

They are thus a combination of the depth below the transducer, the depth of the transducer (WLZ, heave, induced heave and Tx-Z in the SRF). You will note that they are ~ 97m with almost no variation acrossthe swath (a very-very flat seafloor).\n",
