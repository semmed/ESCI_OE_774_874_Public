    "The virtual array is constructed at the mid point between the Tx location on transmit, and the Rx location on receive. At any single time, the two arrays are actually offset as they cannot be installed at the same place on the hull. Additionally, as these are two separate times, the translation of the entire vessel between those two times should be accounted for.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real time, as the final navigation solution is not yet available, the convention is to have the stored location of the bottom strike referenced in a coordinate system that is relative to a fixed point in the vessel (the RP not the sonar) as it was at a specific epoch ( almost always the Tx time). That coordinate system is oriented in a local level plane that is aligned along and across the vessel. This is fit for purpose when editing swath data as one normally views the solutions in across track coordinates. That way one can see the shape of successive profiles and perform editing based on their continuity (coherence). Many of the artifacts present in swath data are oriented across the swath (e.g. refraction biases, wobbles), or in the along-track.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab, you will locate the Rx and Tx relative to the RP at that instant using lever arms and instantaneous orientation observations. To account for the along track movement of the RP, the vessel speed and azimuth at that time can be used (and knowing the twtt~ 0.23 seconds). Additionally there will be a small azimuth rotation of the SRF between the two epochs"
