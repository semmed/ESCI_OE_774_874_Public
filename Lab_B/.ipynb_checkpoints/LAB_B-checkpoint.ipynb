    "The profiles you will be using as examples are real measurements taken using a **Moving Vessel Profiler” (MVP)**. The model used was an ODIM MVP-300 (The system is now built and marketed by AML). This is designed to be used to take underway profiles to a depth of up to ~300m from a vessel moving at 12 knots. The example is from a MVP-300 installed on the Canadian Coast Guard Ship (CCGS) Amundsen, Canada’s research icebreaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MVP-300 towfishis equipped with a Seabird CTD 911+ sensor measuring **Conductivity** (proxy to salinity), **Temperature**, and pressure (proxy to **Depth**), known as a **CTD**. From those measurements, the speed of sound is modeled for use by the ship-mounted EM300 30 kHz multibeam sonar.\n",
    "\n",
    "The towfish is dragged continuously behind the vessel at a depth just above the multibeam transducer. When released to freefall, it falls at a speed of about 5m/s and thus it takes about one minute to drop from near the surface to 300m. The limiting time however is that taken to winch back in the sensor. In that time, the vessel has moved forward 60x6m/s = 360m. Thus there is a total of ~ 700-800m of cable deployed. The recovery speed is about 1m/s so it takes about 10 minutes to get all the cable back in.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can thus deploy every ~15 minutes in if need be. For the example shown here it was set to cycle every 30 minutes."

Thus, you are tracing, keeping track of the TWTT accumulated until you arrive at your desired depth. As a result of this you will calculate an array of TWTTs and radial distances for the range of incidence angles you are testing for (for example 0 to 70 degrees at 1 degree intervals).
